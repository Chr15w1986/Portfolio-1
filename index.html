            <h2>Frame Styles</h2>
            <p>Trials bikes are often designed without regard for attaching a seat. Competition riding does not require
                the rider to sit down and the omission allows for a lighter bike which interferes less with the body
                movements of the rider. For the same reason most trials frames are as low as possible, often to such a
                degree that at top dead centre, the pedals are higher than the frame is above the bottom bracket (BB).
                In terms of geometry, trials frames, especially those biased towards competition, tend to have BB
                spindles positioned significantly higher than the line between the axles. BB rise is one of the
                significant dimensions used in describing a trials frame with rises between 30 and 75 mm being common in
                26" frames. Many competition style 24" frames aim to place the BB at the same height relative to the
                ground as a 26" frame and so have a BB rise 25 mm (1") more than a similar feeling 26" frame. Street
                riding biased 24 and 26" frames tend to have lower BB's than competition frames.</p>

            <h2>Brakes</h2>
            <h4>Rim vs Disc</h4>
            <p> Trials brakes must create more stopping torque than standard bicycle brakes and are set up, especially on
                the rear, with more emphasis on locking the wheel they act on than bringing the bike to a smooth halt
                from speed. For larger wheeled trials bikes, brakes that act directly on the rim are more popular,
                namely hydraulic rim brakes and cable actuated V Brakes, though disk brakes are also used, especially on
                the front wheel, by most riders. Virtually all competition only riders on 26" wheeled bikes use
                hydraulic rim brakes on both wheels, while for 20" competition the split is more even between rim brakes
                and disks.
                The main reason for the preference for rim brake on the back of 26" wheeled bikes is that there is
                significant wind-up between the wheel rim and the hub while hopping on the back wheel thanks to the
                longer spokes and bigger wheel and disk diameter used compared to a 20" wheel. This occurs because disk
                brakes hold the hub still rather than the rim. The effect is noticeable as a springiness in the bike
                when on the back wheel and this feels less precise and confidence inspiring to many riders than a rim
                brake, which holds the wheel directly at the rim.</p>

            <h4>Rim grinding</h4>
            <p> To make a rim brake lock the wheel as firmly as possible a number of techniques are used. The most
                common is where the braking surface of the rim is roughened using an angle grinder. This creates what
                trials riders refer to as a ground rim. Rim grinds can vary from quite light where the rim surface is
                very slightly roughened, all the way to a 'harsh' grind, where the rim has deep grooves (Heading for 1
                mm deep if very harsh) in it. A grind may be referred to as 'dead' if it has been used a lot and the
                brake pads have started to polish it back smooth. Depending on the weather conditions and the brake pad
                compound chosen, different levels of grind are required for peak brake performance. Ground rims give
                consistent lock and hold in all but the muddiest conditions, making them more popular in wetter climates
                than smooth rims.</p>

            <h4>Rim tar</h4>
            <p> Other methods of increasing braking power for rim brakes include rubbing a very thin layer of roofing or
                road tar on the braking surface of a smooth rim. This works by effectively sticking the brake pads to
                the rim and for this reason, much harder pads than are suitable for ground rims can be used with good
                results and excellent pad durability compared to ground rims. Since the pads stick to the rim, the brake
                often doesn't release as cleanly as a ground brake or a disk however.
                The main downside to this method is that, similar to a smooth rim, even small amounts of moisture will
                drastically reduce the stopping performance of this braking setup. Some spray-on products are available
                to coat rims to give a tar like stopping performance. Generally only riders who live in very dry
                climates or ride only on dry surfaces in dry weather favour this method of enhancing the brake.</p>

            <h4>Brake boosters</h4>
            <p> Rim brakes are also often enhanced by fitting 'brake boosters'. These are horseshoe-shaped plates that
                are bolted between the brake pistons (Or arms in the case of V Brakes), forming a bridge over the tIre.
                This increases the force needed to push the brakes apart, giving a stiffer feel at the brake lever and
                in many cases better brake bite and hold. In hydraulic rim brakes, this has a second benefit which is to
                protect the brake line which loops over the tire between the brake pistons from being accidentally hit
                and broken.</p>

            <h4>Other considerations</h4>
            <p> Street-biased riders tend to choose disk brakes more often. Part of this is that disks are almost
                invariably better at controlling the speed of a bike while it is rolling, that is they can take more
                energy per unit time from the rider (i.e. they have more power, which is why they dominate all other
                off-road cycling disciplines), but most disks will not hold a wheel locked as firmly as a rim brake,
                making them less desirable for competition trials.[citation needed] Rim brakes set up for trials tend to
                squeal or howl if they are pulled while the wheel is turning, occasionally leading to trials riders
                attracting undesirable attention or being considered a nuisance for noise pollution.
                UCI regulations only stipulate that the bike must have a working front and rear brake.</p>
