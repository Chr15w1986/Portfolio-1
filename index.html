                <h2>Frame Styles</h2>
                <p>Trials bikes are often designed without regard for attaching a seat. Competition riding does not
                    require
                    the rider to sit down and the omission allows for a lighter bike which interferes less with the body
                    movements of the rider. For the same reason most trials frames are as low as possible, often to such
                    a
                    degree that at top dead centre, the pedals are higher than the frame is above the bottom bracket
                    (BB).
                    In terms of geometry, trials frames, especially those biased towards competition, tend to have BB
                    spindles positioned significantly higher than the line between the axles..</p>
                <h2>Brakes</h2>
                <h4>Rim vs Disc</h4>
                <p> Trials brakes must create more stopping torque than standard bicycle brakes and are set up,
                    especially
                    on
                    the rear, with more emphasis on locking the wheel they act on than bringing the bike to a smooth
                    halt
                    from speed. For larger wheeled trials bikes, brakes that act directly on the rim are more popular,
                    namely hydraulic rim brakes and cable actuated V Brakes, though disk brakes are also used,
                    especially on
                    the front wheel, by most riders. Virtually all competition only riders on 26" wheeled bikes use
                    hydraulic rim brakes on both wheels, while for 20" competition the split is more even between rim
                    brakes
                    and disks.
                </p>

                <h4>Rim grinding</h4>
                <p> To make a rim brake lock the wheel as firmly as possible a number of techniques are used. The most
                    common is where the braking surface of the rim is roughened using an angle grinder. This creates
                    what
                    trials riders refer to as a ground rim. Rim grinds can vary from quite light where the rim surface
                    is
                    very slightly roughened, all the way to a 'harsh' grind, where the rim has deep grooves (Heading for
                    1
                    mm deep if very harsh) in it. A grind may be referred to as 'dead' if it has been used a lot and the
                    brake pads have started to polish it back smooth. Depending on the weather conditions and the brake
                    pad
                    compound chosen, different levels of grind are required for peak brake performance. Ground rims give
                    consistent lock and hold in all but the muddiest conditions, making them more popular in wetter
                    climates
                    than smooth rims.</p>

                <h4>Rim tar</h4>
                <p> Other methods of increasing braking power for rim brakes include rubbing a very thin layer of
                    roofing or
                    road tar on the braking surface of a smooth rim. This works by effectively sticking the brake pads
                    to
                    the rim and for this reason, much harder pads than are suitable for ground rims can be used with
                    good
                    results and excellent pad durability compared to ground rims. Since the pads stick to the rim, the
                    brake
                    often doesn't release as cleanly as a ground brake or a disk however.
                    The main downside to this method is that, similar to a smooth rim, even small amounts of moisture
                    will
                    drastically reduce the stopping performance of this braking setup. Some spray-on products are
                    available
                    to coat rims to give a tar like stopping performance. Generally only riders who live in very dry
                    climates or ride only on dry surfaces in dry weather favour this method of enhancing the brake.</p>

                <h4>Brake boosters</h4>
                <p> Rim brakes are also often enhanced by fitting 'brake boosters'. These are horseshoe-shaped plates
                    that
                    are bolted between the brake pistons (Or arms in the case of V Brakes), forming a bridge over the
                    tIre.
                    This increases the force needed to push the brakes apart, giving a stiffer feel at the brake lever
                    and
                    in many cases better brake bite and hold. In hydraulic rim brakes, this has a second benefit which
                    is to
                    protect the brake line which loops over the tire between the brake pistons from being accidentally
                    hit
                    and broken.</p>
