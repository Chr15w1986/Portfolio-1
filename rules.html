                <h2>Rules</h2>
                <p>
                    In a bike trials competition, the general principle is to ride a number of pre-marked sections.
                    Typically, there are two laps of ten sections or three laps of seven sections. The winner is the
                    rider with the fewest points at the end of the competition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, there are two official types of competition rules enforced by the UCI (Union Cycliste
                    Internationale) and BikeTrial International Union (BIU). The maximum number of points that can be
                    obtained in each section is 5, and the lowest (best) score is 0 points or 'clean'. Points, sometimes
                    referred to as 'dabs', are gained when a rider puts a foot down within a section. Different rules
                    exist for the number of points gained, such as putting both feet down or a hand resulting in 5
                    points. Exceeding the time limit for the course leads to either 5 points (BIU rules) or an
                    additional point for every 15 seconds over the limit (UCI rules).

                <h2>UCI</h2>
                <p>
                    Under UCI rules, a "dab" is given if any part of the bike except the tires touches any object in the
                    course, including shoulders, elbows, and knees. The UCI rules were changed to this format after many
                    competitions ended in a draw, and riders were forced to ride an extra section. UCI rules also allow
                    riders to compete in both mod and stock categories. During a section, neither tire is allowed to
                    cross the side boundary tape, even if the wheel is in the air. The rider's hands must remain on the
                    handlebars. Before beginning a section, a rider is allowed to walk through it and examine all the
                    elements but must not enter it with their bike.
                </p>

                <h2>Course Design</h2>
                <p>
                    According to UCI regulations, a course must consist of at least 14 sections, including repeated
                    sections. At most, two sections can be composed entirely of artificial elements. Both sides of the
                    course are marked with plastic tape, and there must be a clear stretch of 3 meters prior to the
                    finish line to prevent riders from jumping over the line from an obstacle. Maximum obstacle jump
                    heights are specified, ranging from 0.80 to 1.80 meters depending on the category. The sections,
                    each approximately 60 meters in length, are laid out on a circuit to allow riders to move from one
                    section to the next, although the order in which the sections must be completed depends on the
                    individual competition.

                <h2>Street Trials</h2>
                <p>
                    Street trials, or freestyle bike trials, is a non-competitive variant that incorporates features
                    found in urban environments. It is the trials equivalent of street skateboarding or street freestyle
                    BMX. Street trials riding is more fluid than competitive trials riding, encompassing the same skills
                    such as precise control of the bike, accurate landing points, jumps, and balancing on narrow
                    obstacles. Riders like <strong>Danny Macaskill</strong> have mastered riding through urban
                    situations, showcasing their abilities just as we can walk on two feet.

                <h2>Frame Styles</h2>
                <p>
                    Trials bikes are often designed without seats as trial riding does not require the rider to sit
                    down. This omission allows for a lighter bike that interferes less with the rider's body movements.
                    For the same reason, most trials frames are as low as possible, with the pedals often higher than
                    the frame above the bottom bracket (BB) at the top dead center. In terms of geometry, trials frames,
                    especially those biased towards competition, tend to have BB spindles positioned significantly
                    higher than the line between the axles.
