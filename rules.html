                <h2>Rules</h2> <br>
                <p> The general principle in a bike trials competition is to ride a number of pre-marked sections
                    (usually
                    two laps of ten sections or three laps of seven sections), the winner being the rider with the
                    fewest
                    points at the end of the competition.

                    Currently there are two official types of competition rules, enforced by the UCI and BikeTrial
                    International Union (BIU).

                    The maximum number of points that can be obtained in each section is 5, the lowest (and best) score
                    is 0
                    points or 'clean'. The most common way to gain a point is by putting a foot down within a section;
                    for
                    this reason points are sometimes known as 'dabs'. Certain rules enforce the number of points gained
                    within a section, for example, putting both feet down or a hand will result in 5 points. Exceeding
                    the
                    time limit for the course will either result in 5 points (BIU rules) or an additional point for
                    every 15
                    seconds over the limit (UCI rules).

                <h2>UCI</h2><br>

                <p>Within UCI rules, if any part of the bike except the tires touch any object in the course, a dab will
                    be given. This includes: Shoulders, Elbows and Knees. The UCI rules were changed to this format
                    after too many competitions ended in a draw and
                    riders were forced to ride an extra section. UCI rules also allows riders to compete in both mod and
                    stock categories.

                    When a rider is in a section, neither tire is allowed to cross the side boundary tape even if the
                    wheel
                    is in the air. The rider's hands must remain on the handlebars. Before beginning a section, a rider
                    is
                    allowed to walk through it, and examine all the elements, but must not enter it with their bike.

                    The UCI Mountain Bike & Trials World Championships are held annually and crown a 20-inch and 26-inch
                    wheel Trials World Champion.</p><br>

                <h2>Course design</h2><br>
                <p> UCI regulations stipulate that a course consist of at least 14 sections per course, including
                    repeated sections. At most two sections can be composed entirely of artificial elements. Both sides
                    of
                    the course are marked with plastic tape, and there must be a clear stretch of 3 metres prior to the
                    finish line, in order to prevent riders jumping over the line from an obstacle. Maximum obstacle
                    jump
                    heights are specified, from 0.80 to 1.80 metres depending on category. The sections, each
                    approximately
                    60m in length, are laid out on a circuit to allow riders to ride from one section to the next, but
                    whether the sections have to be completed in order depends on the individual competition.</p><br>

                <h2>Street trials</h2><br>
                <p>Street trials, or freestyle bike trials, is a non-competitive variant, using features found in the
                    urban
                    environment. It is the trials equivalent of street skateboarding or street freestyle BMX. More fluid
                    than competitive trials riding, it encompasses the same skills: very precise control of the bike,
                    accurate landing points,
                    through jumps and balancing on very narrow obstacles. Street trials riders such as <strong>Danny
                        Macaskill</strong> have mastered riding through urban situations, just like me and you can walk
                    on two feet.</p><br>

                <h2>Frame Styles</h2><br>
                <p>Trials bikes are often designed without regard for attaching a seat. Trial riding does not
                    require
                    the rider to sit down and the omission allows for a lighter bike which interferes less with the body
                    movements of the rider. For the same reason most trials frames are as low as possible, often to such
                    a
                    degree that at top dead centre, the pedals are higher than the frame is above the bottom bracket
                    (BB).
                    In terms of geometry, trials frames, especially those biased towards competition, tend to have BB
                    spindles positioned significantly higher than the line between the axles..</p><br>
