                <h2>Rules</h2> <br>
                <p> The general principle in a bike trials competition is to ride a number of pre-marked sections
                    (usually
                    two laps of ten sections or three laps of seven sections), the winner being the rider with the
                    fewest
                    points at the end of the competition.

                    Currently there are two official types of competition rules, enforced by the UCI and BikeTrial
                    International Union (BIU).

                    The maximum number of points that can be obtained in each section is 5, the lowest (and best) score
                    is 0
                    points or 'clean'. The most common way to gain a point is by putting a foot down within a section;
                    for
                    this reason points are sometimes known as 'dabs'. Certain rules enforce the number of points gained
                    within a section, for example, putting both feet down or a hand will result in 5 points. Exceeding
                    the
                    time limit for the course will either result in 5 points (BIU rules) or an additional point for
                    every 15
                    seconds over the limit (UCI rules).</p><br>

                <h2>UCI</h2><br>

                <p>Within UCI rules, if any part of the bike except the tires touch any object in the course, a dab will
                    be given. This includes: Shoulders, Elbows and Knees. The UCI rules were changed to this format
                    after too many competitions ended in a draw and
                    riders were forced to ride an extra section. UCI rules also allows riders to compete in both mod and
                    stock categories.

                    When a rider is in a section, neither tire is allowed to cross the side boundary tape even if the
                    wheel
                    is in the air. The rider's hands must remain on the handlebars. Before beginning a section, a rider
                    is
                    allowed to walk through it, and examine all the elements, but must not enter it with their bike.

                    The UCI Mountain Bike & Trials World Championships are held annually and crown a 20-inch and 26-inch
                    wheel Trials World Champion.</p><br>

                <h2>Course design</h2><br>
                <p> UCI regulations stipulate that a course consist of at least 14 sections per course, including
                    repeated sections. At most two sections can be composed entirely of artificial elements. Both sides
                    of
                    the course are marked with plastic tape, and there must be a clear stretch of 3 metres prior to the
                    finish line, in order to prevent riders jumping over the line from an obstacle. Maximum obstacle
                    jump
                    heights are specified, from 0.80 to 1.80 metres depending on category. The sections, each
                    approximately
                    60m in length, are laid out on a circuit to allow riders to ride from one section to the next, but
                    whether the sections have to be completed in order depends on the individual competition.</p><br>

                <h2>Street trials</h2><br>
                <p>Street trials, or freestyle bike trials, is a non-competitive variant, using features found in the
                    urban
                    environment. It is the trials equivalent of street skateboarding or street freestyle BMX. More fluid
                    than competitive trials riding, it encompasses the same skills: very precise control of the bike,
                    accurate landing points,
                    through jumps and balancing on very narrow obstacles. Street trials riders such as <strong>Danny
                        Macaskill</strong> have mastered riding through urban situations, just like me and you can walk
                    on two feet.</p><br>

                <h2>Frame Styles</h2><br>
                <p>Trials bikes are often designed without regard for attaching a seat. Trial riding does not
                    require
                    the rider to sit down and the omission allows for a lighter bike which interferes less with the body
                    movements of the rider. For the same reason most trials frames are as low as possible, often to such
                    a
                    degree that at top dead centre, the pedals are higher than the frame is above the bottom bracket
                    (BB).
                    In terms of geometry, trials frames, especially those biased towards competition, tend to have BB
                    spindles positioned significantly higher than the line between the axles..</p><br>

                <h2>Brakes</h2><br>
                <p>Rim vs Disc:<br>
                 Trials brakes must create more stopping torque than standard bicycle brakes and are set up,
                    especially
                    on
                    the rear, with more emphasis on locking the wheel they act on than bringing the bike to a smooth
                    halt
                    from speed. For larger wheeled trials bikes, brakes that act directly on the rim are more popular,
                    namely hydraulic rim brakes and cable actuated V Brakes, though disk brakes are also used,
                    especially on
                    the front wheel, by most riders. Virtually all competition only riders on 26" wheeled bikes use
                    hydraulic rim brakes on both wheels, while for 20" competition the split is more even between rim
                    brakes
                    and disks.</p><br>

                <h4>Rim grinding</h4><br>
                <p> To make a rim brake lock the wheel as firmly as possible a number of techniques are used. The most
                    common is where the braking surface of the rim is roughened using an angle grinder. This creates
                    what
                    trials riders refer to as a ground rim. Rim grinds can vary from quite light where the rim surface
                    is
                    very slightly roughened, all the way to a 'harsh' grind, where the rim has deep grooves (Heading for
                    1
                    mm deep if very harsh) in it. A grind may be referred to as 'dead' if it has been used a lot and the
                    brake pads have started to polish it back smooth. Depending on the weather conditions and the brake
                    pad
                    compound chosen, different levels of grind are required for peak brake performance. Ground rims give
                    consistent lock and hold in all but the muddiest conditions, making them more popular in wetter
                    climates
                    than smooth rims.</p><br>

                <h4>Rim tar</h4><br>
                <p> Other methods of increasing braking power for rim brakes include rubbing a very thin layer of
                    roofing or
                    road tar on the braking surface of a smooth rim. This works by effectively sticking the brake pads
                    to
                    the rim and for this reason, much harder pads than are suitable for ground rims can be used with
                    good
                    results and excellent pad durability compared to ground rims. Since the pads stick to the rim, the
                    brake
                    often doesn't release as cleanly as a ground brake or a disk however.
                    The main downside to this method is that, similar to a smooth rim, even small amounts of moisture
                    will
                    drastically reduce the stopping performance of this braking setup. Some spray-on products are
                    available
                    to coat rims to give a tar like stopping performance. Generally only riders who live in very dry
                    climates or ride only on dry surfaces in dry weather favour this method of enhancing the brake.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Brake boosters</h4><br>
                <p> Rim brakes are also often enhanced by fitting 'brake boosters'. These are horseshoe-shaped plates
                    that
                    are bolted between the brake pistons (Or arms in the case of V Brakes), forming a bridge over the
                    tIre.
                    This increases the force needed to push the brakes apart, giving a stiffer feel at the brake lever
                    and
                    in many cases better brake bite and hold. In hydraulic rim brakes, this has a second benefit which
                    is to
                    protect the brake line which loops over the tire between the brake pistons from being accidentally
                    hit
                    and broken.</p>
